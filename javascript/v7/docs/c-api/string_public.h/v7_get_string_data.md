---

Returns a pointer to the string stored in `v7_val_t`.

String length returned in `len`.

JS strings can contain embedded NUL chars and may or may not be NUL
terminated.

CAUTION: creating new JavaScript object, array, or string may kick in a
garbage collector, which in turn may relocate string data and invalidate
pointer returned by `v7_get_string_data()`.

Short JS strings are embedded inside the `v7_val_t` value itself. This is why
a pointer to a `v7_val_t` is required. It also means that the string data
will become invalid once that `v7_val_t` value goes out of scope.
